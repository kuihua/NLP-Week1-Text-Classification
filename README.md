### Warning

In the notebook, in the checkActualvsPredicted(df) function, under the heading "testing data" DO NOT click on the links in the output.

They are bad links, the output is there for error analysis.

There will be a text cell giving a warning at that cell. 

### Datasets

**combined_dataset.csv** - The Kaggle dataset for training/validation.

**myData.csv** - Our created dataset for testing.

### Note

We worked on much of the project together in person or over call on one person's computer, which is why most of the commits are from the same GitHub account.
If you cannot view the notebook from GitHub, please open it from colab (https://colab.google/notebooks/). It is a render issue.
